# Weather App
A weather app that allows users to check the current temperature and view the daily forecast for any location of their choice. This was created as part of The Odin Project curriculum.

## Motivation
This project was made to:
- Challenge myself with a minimalistic and easy-to-read interface for a seamless user experience.
- Practice implementing asynchronous functions to efficiently fetch and display data.
- Get familiar with the process of retrieving weather data from APIs and presenting it in a clean, user-friendly format.

## Quick Start
Publicly available at the following link: https://paulreaver.github.io/Weather-App/

## Usage
Users can simply enter their desired location and click the search button to view detailed weather information. The app provides real-time data, including the current temperature, apparent temperature, and a weather icon for easy visualization. Additionally, a daily forecast is displayed in a series of cards, each showing the date, a weather icon, and the minimum and maximum temperatures for the upcoming days.
